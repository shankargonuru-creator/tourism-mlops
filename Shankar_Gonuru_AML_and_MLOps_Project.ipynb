By utilizing an MLOps pipeline, the company seeks to achieve seamless integration of data preprocessing, model development, deployment, and CI/CD practices for continuous improvement. This system will ensure efficient targeting of customers, timely updates to the predictive model, and adaptation to evolving customer behaviors, ultimately driving growth and customer satisfaction.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zm6bNQOJBblO"},"source":["## **Objective**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7PYtjk_YBblO"},"source":["As an MLOps Engineer at \"Visit with Us,\" your responsibility is to design and deploy an MLOps pipeline on GitHub to automate the end-to-end workflow for predicting customer purchases.

The pipeline will include data cleaning, preprocessing, transformation, model building, training, evaluation, and deployment, ensuring consistent performance and scalability. By leveraging GitHub Actions for CI/CD integration, the system will enable automated updates, streamline model deployment, and improve operational efficiency.
